Project Title:
Task Management App for Remote Workers and Students

Abstract:
The Task Management App for Remote Workers and Students is a straightforward web-based application designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks, assignments, and deadlines. It addresses the common challenge of staying organized and on top of various responsibilities in a remote work or study environment. The app allows users to create, categorize, and view tasks, while providing a simple interface to track progress and mark tasks as complete. Key features include task creation with deadlines, task categorization (e.g., "Work" or "Study"), notifications for approaching deadlines, and a basic progress tracker. By focusing on simplicity, ease of use, and practical functionality, this app offers an intuitive solution for boosting productivity and maintaining organization for both remote workers and students.

Problem Statement:
Remote workers and students often face difficulty managing their tasks, assignments, and deadlines. A simpler tool that helps keep track of tasks and deadlines could make a significant difference in improving productivity.

Proposed Solution:
To address these challenges, this project develop a Task Management Application where users can create, view, and manage their tasks, whether related to their work or studies. This app will allow users to:



    • Add tasks.
    • Set deadlines.
    • Mark tasks as complete.
    • Get reminders about pending tasks.
      
Functional Requirements:
    1. Task Creation:
        ◦ Users should be able to create tasks with a title, description, and due date to organize their responsibilities effectively. 
    2. Task Management:
        ◦ Users can view, edit, and delete tasks, giving them full control over their task list. 
    3. Task Status:
        ◦ Users can mark tasks as "completed" to track their progress and maintain a sense of accomplishment. 
    4. Task Filter:
        ◦ Users should be able to filter tasks based on status and category, helping them focus on specific tasks. 
    5. Task Reminders & Notifications:
        ◦ The app should send timely notifications or reminders to alert users about approaching task deadlines. 
    6. Task Progress Tracker:
        ◦ Users can visually track task completion through a progress tracker, offering a sense of achievement. 
    7. Data Storage:
        ◦ The app should store task data locally or on a server to ensure task information is saved and retrievable. 


    8. User Interface:
        ◦ A simple and responsive user interface should be provided to make the app accessible across different devices and screen sizes. 


Non-Functional Requirements:
    1. Usability:
        ◦ The application should be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly learn how to use it. 
    2. Performance:
        ◦ The app should load quickly and respond to user interactions with minimal delay, ensuring a smooth user experience. 
    3. Reliability:
        ◦ The application should function consistently, with minimal errors and stable performance under typical usage. 
    4. Scalability:
        ◦ The app should be capable of handling an increasing number of tasks and users as it grows without sacrificing performance. 
    5. Accessibility:
        ◦ The application should be designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring it can be used by all individuals, including those with disabilities. 
    6. Security:
        ◦ The app should ensure that user data is securely stored and protected, especially in cases involving personal information or login systems. 
    7. Compatibility:
        ◦ The application should work seamlessly across various web browsers and devices, providing a consistent experience. 
    8. Maintainability:
        ◦ The app should be developed with clean, organized, and well-documented code to ease future updates and bug fixes. 
    9. Deployment:
        ◦ The app should be easy to deploy and accessible on popular hosting platforms, with minimal setup required.
